= A Day in Java Developer's Life, with a taste of Kubernetes

Deploying your Java application in a Kubernetes cluster could feel like Alice in Wonderland. You keep going down the rabbit hole and don't know how to make that ride comfortable. This no-slide and code-only session will explain how a Java application consisting of different microservices can be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster. Specifically, it will explain the following:

- Show a Java application with three microservices
- How this application is packaged as a Docker image
- Create Kubernetes manifests
- How Helm charts are created and hosted in a Helm repository
- Test in a local environment such as minikube
- Attach debugger (may need to find out if tooling exists in this area)
- Install Istio in k8s, show service visibility
- Install k8s on AWS
- Migrate application from a local cluster to a cluster on the Cloud
- Setup deployment pipeline using CodePipeline
- Use an Alexa skill to scale the application
- Change application, show A/B using Istio
