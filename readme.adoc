= A Day in Java Developer's Life, with a taste of Kubernetes
:toc:

Deploying your Java application in a Kubernetes cluster could feel like Alice in Wonderland. You keep going down the rabbit hole and don't know how to make that ride comfortable. This repository explains how a Java application consisting of three  microservices can be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.

== Microservices

The three microservices are:

. `webapp`: Web application microservice calls `greeting` and `name` microservice to generate a greeting for a person.
. `greeting`: A microservice that returns a greeting.
. `name`: A microservice that returns a personâ€™s name based upon `{id}` in the URL.

== Build and Test Services using Maven

. Each microservice is in a different repo:
+
[cols="1,3"]
|====
| `greeting` | https://github.com/arun-gupta/microservices-greeting
| `name` | https://github.com/arun-gupta/microservices-name
| `webapp` | https://github.com/arun-gupta/microservices-webapp
|====
+
. Clone all the repos. Open each one in a separate terminal.
. Run `greeting` service: `mvn wildfly-swarm:run`
.. Optionally test: `curl http://localhost:8081/resources/greeting`
. Run `name` service: `mvn wildfly-swarm:run`
.. Optionally test:
... `curl http://localhost:8082/resources/names`
... `curl http://localhost:8082/resources/names/1`
. Run `webapp` service: `mvn wildfly-swarm:run`
. Run the application: `curl http://localhost:8080/`
